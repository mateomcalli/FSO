         browser->>server: GET initial HTML file
         activate server
         server->>browser: sends HTML file
         deactivate server
 
         browser->>server: GET css and js files, needed after reading HTML
         activate server
         server->>browser: sends css and js
         deactivate server
 
         browser->>server: after reading js, browser GETS json data
         activate server
         server->>browser: sends json data
         deactivate server
 
         Note right of browser: At this point, page has been loaded dynamically, and the sequence after this is when someone adds another note to the form.
 
         browser->>server: sends POST request to server with new user-inputted data
         activate server
         server->>browser: recieves data and responds with 201, uses JS code to store it and add it to the existing notes list. also prevents default GET response that would illicit an entire page reload.
         deactivate server
 
         Note right of browser: After this, the browser sends the new data as JSON strings back to the server using JS logic in the SPA HTML file.
